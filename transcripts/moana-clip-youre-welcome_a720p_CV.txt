What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky, {BR} when you were waddling yay high? This guy! {NS} When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below? You’re looking at him yo! Oh! Also I lassoed the sun, you’re welcome! To stretch your days and bring you fun! Also I harnessed the breeze, you’re welcome! To fill your sails and shake your trees. So what can I say, except, you’re welcome! For the islands I pulled from the sea. There’s no need to pray, it’s okay, you’re welcome! Ha! I guess it’s just my way of being me! You’re welcome! You’re welcome!
