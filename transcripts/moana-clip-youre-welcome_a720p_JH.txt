What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky when you were waddling yay high? This guy. When the nights got cold, who stole you fire from down below? You're lookin' at him, yo. Oh, also I lassoed the sun, you're welcome, to stretch the days and bring you fun. Also I harnessed the breeze, you're welcome, to fill your sails and shake your trees.

I guess it's just my way of being me. {NS} You're welcome, you're welcome.
